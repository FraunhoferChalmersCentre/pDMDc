<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Framework to predict and to metabotype Omics time series data from several diet interventions. 


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Run pDMDc_metabotyping_example.m and pDMDc_prediction_example.m to see examples for metabotyping and prediction of metabolomics time series. Run pDMDc_prediction_simulation_test.m to run prediction tests on simulated data with different levels of noise. The data needs to be structured in tensor/multidimensional array format and organized as described in the example files. The simulated data available is generated from the data from Svelander et al. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-014-0771-3.
